ORC-HL-PEAT

High latitude version of the land surface model ORCHIDEE (branch MICT of the model) (rev ) including the peatlands scheme. This scheme is also available here: https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/orchidee/log/perso/chloe.largeron/ORCHIDEE-CURRENT

This scheme is used with 14th PFT so the 14th PFT map that I have created is needed. The following flag have to be set to true to considers the configuration of peatlands: #Peatland logical use : remplace OK_STAGNANT y remplace OK_NO_DRAINAGE y remplace OK_REINFILT_PEAT y

#Gel du sol : remplace OK_FREEZE y remplace OK_ECORR y
