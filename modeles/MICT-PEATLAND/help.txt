   This is a "low level" subroutine for opening netCDF files wich
    !     contain the major coordinate system of the model. Other coordinates 
    !     needed for other variables will be added as they are needed.  
    !
    !     INPUT
    !
    !     filename    : Name of the file to be created
    !     iim1, jjm1  : Horizontal size of the grid which will be stored in the
    !                   file
    !     lon1, lat1  : Horizontal grids
    !     llm1        : Size of the vertical grid
    !     lev1        : Vertical grid
    !     ttm1        : Size of time axis
    !     itaus       : time steps on the time axis
    !     time0       : Time in julian days at which itau = 0
    !     dt          : time step in seconds between itaus (one step of itau)
    !
    !     OUTPUT
    !
    !     fid         : File identification
    !     nlonid1     : Identification of longitudinal axis
    !     nlatid1     : Identification of latitudinal axis
    !     zdimid1     : ID of vertical axis
    !     tdimid1     : ID of time axis
